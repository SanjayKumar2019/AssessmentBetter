# Node.js CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates the setup of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application. The pipeline is powered by GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Approach

### CI Workflow
1. **Test on Pull Requests**: The workflow runs tests automatically on every pull request to the `main` branch.
2. **Build Docker Image**: On merging to `main`, the application is containerized using Docker.
3. **Kubernetes Deployment**: The Docker image is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

### Secrets
Make sure to store the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` for Docker login.
- `KUBECONFIG` for Kubernetes access.
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for deployment notifications.

### Kubernetes Setup
The deployment is handled by a simple Kubernetes YAML file located in the `kubernetes/` directory.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` to run the test suite.
